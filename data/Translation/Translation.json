If ni = 9 and nioghalvfjerds = 79, it seems fair to assume that -oghalvfjerds describes \u2018and 70\u2019. We see similar constructions with og among the other terms, so a reasonable guess would be that og is \u2018and\u2019, and that the remaining part of the word denotes the multiple of ten.\n\nThat would make: tyve = 20, halvtreds = 50, tres = 60, and firs = 80.\n\nThe fact that the word for 60 looks like the word for 3, and the word for 80 looks like the word for 4, leads to the conclusion that this is a base-20 system. Firs = 4 x 20 (four score) and tres = 3 x 20 (three score). But why is halvtreds = 50?\n\nThe \u2018odd\u2019 tens \u2013 50, 70 and 90 \u2013 are considered \u2018half way\u2019 from one score to the next. Thus halvtreds means \u2018half way to the third score,\u2019 as in \u2018half way between 40 and 60.\u2019 Correspondingly, halvfjerds is \u2018half way to the fourth score\u2019, or 70, and halvfems is 90, or \u2018half way to the fifth score\u2019.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty confusing, especially for foreign tourists in Copenhagen, that the word for 50 doesn\u2019t have the word for 5 in it, but instead the words for \u2018half\u2019 and 3. Indeed the Danish authorities once tried to introduce regular forms for numbers \u2013 femti (50), seksti (60), syvti (70), otti (80), and niti (90) \u2013 for bank notes and cheques, but the words never caught on. In 1952 a 50 kroner banknote was introduced that said femti kroner on it. But no one ever said femti, so it was taken out of circulation, and in 2009 was replaced by one reading halvtreds.\n\n7: syv\n54: fireoghalvtreds \n21: enogtyve\n85: femogfirs\n99: ni-og-halvfems\n\n\n"}, "15": {"Question": "The following four words are common to Danish, Norwegian and Swedish:\nmormor, morfar, farmor, farfar \nThe first word can be translated as \u2018grandmother\u2019.
