"Suppose I have an 8x8 grid. The columns are labeled 1-8 from left to right, and the rows are labeled A-H from top to bottom. All cells are empty except for cell B-3 which has a rat, and cells F-6, which has cheese. What is the exact series of cells the rat can move through to get to the cheese as quickly as possible? Assume the rat can only move up- down-left-right to adjacent cells, and not diagonally.

"," There are several solutions with the length of 7.

All cells are empty except for cell B-3 which has a rat, and cells F-6, which has cheese. Suppose that the following cells are impassable, the rat cannot go through them: D4, D5, D6, D7, E4, F4. What is the exact series of cells the rat can move through to get to the cheese as quickly as possible? Assume the rat can only move up-down- left-right to adjacent cells, and not diagonally.

"," The shortest path has a length of 9. One possible solution is 
 
 B-3 -> C-3 -> D-3 -> E-3 -> F-3 -> G-3 -> G-4 -> G-5 -> G-6 -> F-6.

"You will be given a name of an object (such as Car, Chair, Elephant) and a letter in the alphabet. Your
goal is to first produce a 1-line description of how that object can be combined with the letter in an
