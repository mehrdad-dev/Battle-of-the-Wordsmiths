"At Amalgamated Artichokes (AA), Ali works as an analyst and conducts trending analysis of the company's stock prices. AA, like any other company, has experienced both good and bad times. Ali's goal is to identify the biggest drop in stock prices over different time intervals. For instance, if the stock prices were 19, 12, 13, 11, 20, and 14 over a specific period, the most significant decrease would be 8 between the first and fourth price. However, if the final price was 10 instead of 14, the most significant decline would be 10 between the last two prices. Ali has previously conducted some analyses and discovered that the stock price for any given period can be reasonably modeled using the following equation.

price(k) = p · (sin(a · k + b) + cos(c · k + d) + 2) 

where p, a, b, c and d are constants. Ali would like you to write a program to determine the largest price decline over a given sequence of prices. You have to consider the prices only for integer values of k. 

Input

The input consists of a single line containing 6 integers $p (1 <= p <= 1000), a, b, c, d (0 <= a, b, c, d <= 1 000)$ and $n (1 <= n <= 10^6)$. The first 5 integers are described above. The sequence of stock prices to consider is price(1), price(2), ... , price(n).

Output 

Display the maximum decline in the stock prices. If there is no decline, display the number 0. 
Your output should have an absolute or relative error of at most $10^{-6}$.

Sample Input 1		        		Sample Output 1

"You have been hired by the Association for Climatological Measurement, a scientific organization interested in tracking global weather trends over a long period of time. Of course, this is no easy task. They have deployed many small devices around the world, designed to take periodic measurements of the local weather conditions. These are cheap devices with somewhat restricted capabilities. Every day they observe which of the four standard kinds of weather occurred: Sunny, Cloudy, Rainy, or Frogs. After every n of these observations have been made, the results are reported to the main server for analysis. However, the massive number of devices has caused the available communication bandwidth to be overloaded. The Association needs your help to come up with a method of compressing these reports into fewer bits. For a particular device’s location, you may assume that the weather each day is an independent random event, and you are given the predicted probabilities of the four possible weather types. Each of the $4^n$ possible weather reports for a device must be encoded as a unique sequence of bits, such that no sequence is a prefix of any other sequence (an important property, or else the server would not know when each sequence ends). The goal is to use an encoding that minimizes the expected number of transmitted bits.

Input 

The first line of input contains an integer $1 leq n leq 20$, the number of observations that go into each report. The second line contains four positive floating-point numbers, p_sunny, p_cloudy, p_rainy, and p_frogs, representing the respective weather probabilities. These probabilities have at most 6 digits after the decimal point and sum to 1.

Output 

Display the minimum expected number of bits in the encoding of a report, with an absolute or relative error of at most $10^{-4}$.

"write python code to solve the following problem  
A message has been enciphered using a simple substitution cipher. This means that a permutation of the alphabet has been chosen and each letter of the original message has been replaced by the corresponding letter of the permuted alphabet. For example, using the permutation:

A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z 
J X R I D Z T A Q K E B H P W C O L F S V M G Y U N

becomes the message 
SAD RJS QF WVS WZ SAD XJT

The frequency of occurrence of letters in English text is not uniform; the letter E occurs most often, followed by T, etc. Given a sufficiently large enciphered message, the frequencies of occurrence of the letters should indicate which letters are represented. For example, if the letter D occurred most often in the enciphered message, we would expect it to represent the letter E, as it does in the above example.

Your program must decipher an enciphered message using this idea. The data consist of two messages. The first message will be of the normal English text (unenciphered). Your program should use this text to determine the relative frequencies of the letters in normal English. The second message will be an enciphered message. Your program should determine the relative frequencies of occurrence of the letters in this message, then decipher the message by substituting for each occurrence of the k-th most frequent letter, the k-th most frequent letter of plain English text. Print out the deciphered message.

Input consists of up to 20 lines of plain text, then a line with an asterisk in column 1, then up to 20 lines of enciphered text, then another asterisk in column 1. Spaces and punctuation will not be enciphered. All text will be uppercase only.""
