"Context:
Psychologist: Phonemic awareness, or the knowledge that spoken language can be broken into component
sounds, is essential for learning to read an alphabetic language. But one also needs to learn how sounds are
symbolically represented by means of letters; otherwise, phonemic awareness will not translate into the ability
to read an alphabetic language. Yet many children who are taught by the whole-language method, which
emphasizes the ways words sound, learn to read alphabetic languages.
Question: Which one of the following can be properly inferred from the psychologist’s statements?
Options:
A. The whole-language method invariably succeeds in teaching awareness of how spoken language can be
broken into component sounds.
B. Some children who are taught by the whole-language method are not prevented from learning how sounds
are represented by means of letters.
C. The whole-language method succeeds in teaching many children how to represent sounds symbolically by
means of letters.

"Definition: identify the claim that must be true or is required in order for the argument to work
Context:
Slash-and-burn agriculture involves burning several acres of forest, leaving vegetable ash that provides
ample fertilizer for three or four years of bountiful crops. On the cleared land nutrients leach out of the
soil, however, and the land becomes too poor to support agriculture. New land is then cleared by burning
and the process starts again. Since most farming in the tropics uses this method, forests in this region will
eventually be permanently eradicated.
Question: The argument depends on the assumption that
Options:
A. forests in the tropics do not regenerate well enough to restore themselves once they have been cleared
by the slash-and-burn method
B. some other methods of agriculture are not as destructive to the environment in tropical regions as the
slash-and-burn method is
C. forests in the tropics are naturally deficient in nutrients that are needed to support the growth of plants
that are not native to those regions

Context:
Geologist: A new method for forecasting earthquakes has reliably predicted several earthquakes. Unfortunately, this method can predict only that an earthquake will fall somewhere within a range of two and
a half points on the Richter scale. Thus, since a difference of two and a half points can be the difference
between a marginally perceptible shaking and a quake that causes considerable damage, the new method
is unlikely to be useful.
Question: Which one of the following, if assumed, enables the geologist’s conclusion to be properly
inferred?
Options:
A. An earthquake-forecasting method is unlikely to be useful unless its predictions always differentiate earthquakes that are barely noticeable from ones that result in substantial destruction.
B. Several well-established methods for forecasting earthquakes can predict within much narrower ranges than two and a half points on the Richter scale.
C. Even if an earthquake-forecasting method makes predictions within a very narrow range on the Richter scale, this method is not likely to be useful unless its predictions are reliable.
D. An earthquake-forecasting method has not been shown to be useful until it has been used to reliably
predict a large number of earthquakes.

“DNA fingerprinting” is a recently-introduced biochemical procedure that uses a pattern derived from a
person’ s genetic material to match a suspect’ s genetic material against that of a specimen from a crime
scene. Proponents have claimed astronomically high odds against obtaining a match by chance alone.
These odds are based on an assumption that there is independence between the different characteristics
represented by a single pattern.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, casts the most doubt on the claim of the proponents of
DNA fingerprinting?
Options:
A. The skill required of laboratory technicians performing the DNA fingerprinting procedure is not extraordinary.
B. There is a generally accepted theoretical basis for interpreting the patterns produced by the procedure.
C. In the whole population there are various different subgroups, within each of which certain sets of
genetic characteristics are shared.

person’ s faithfulness. Virtues are by definition praiseworthy, which is why no one considers resentment

After a nuclear power plant accident, researchers found radioactive isotopes of iodine, tellurium, and
cesium-but no heavy isotopes-in the atmosphere downwind. This material came either from spent fuel
rods or from the plant’ s core. Spent fuel rods never contain significant quantities of tellurium isotopes.
Radioactive material ejected into the atmosphere directly from the core would include heavy isotopes.
After the accident, steam, which may have been in contact with the core, was released from the plant. The
core contains iodine, tellurium, and cesium isotopes, which are easily dissolved by steam.
Question:
Of the following statements, which one is most strongly supported by the information above?
Options:
A. The nuclear power plant’s spent fuel rods were not damaged.
B. Spent fuel rods do not contain heavy isotopes in significant quantities.
C. The researchers found some radioactive material from spent fuel rods as well as some material that was

To reduce the mosquito population in a resort area, hundreds of trees were planted that bear fruit attractive
to birds. Over the years, as the trees matured, they attracted a variety of bird species and greatly increased
the summer bird population in the area. As expected, the birds ate many mosquitoes. However, the
planting of the fruit trees had the very opposite of its intended effect.

The position that punishment should be proportional to how serious the offense is but that repeat offenders
should receive harsher punishments than first-time offenders is unsustainable. It implies that considerations as remote as what an offender did years ago are relevant to the seriousness of an offense. If such remote considerations were relevant, almost every other consideration would be too. But this would make determining the seriousness of an offense so difficult that it would be impossible to apply the proportionality principle.
Question:
The statement that considerations as remote as what an offender did years ago are relevant to the seriousness of an offense plays which one of the following roles in the argument?

A. It is an allegedly untenable consequence of a view rejected in the argument’s overall conclusion.
B. It is a statement the argument provides grounds to accept and from which the overall conclusion is
